# TcpServerResearch

To use, run the TcpServerResearch preoject.

Once it is running, with Ncat installed open CMD and run the following command "ncat 127.0.0.1 13000"

This will establish a connection with the TCP Server.

You should now be able to send and receive messages from the server.

Example : Try typing your name and click enter.

View the results through your own CMD Terminal which acts as the device, and also view the console of the server running is Visual Studio to see from the servers point of view :)
